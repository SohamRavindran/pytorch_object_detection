# pytorch_object_detection
Custom object detection using pytorch

In this project we have used pretrained model of pytorch for detecting objects within an given image.
The instances(labels) from the COCO dataset have been selected for detection within the field

Once the model is imported succesfully the image is given for prediction, after which the model gives the class and the cordiatates of the objects detected.
using these coordinates values we have also created bounding boxes over those objects on the image to get better results.
